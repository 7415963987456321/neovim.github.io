Welcome to the third monthly newsletter for Neovim, the project that TODO.

## General News

### Over 1,000 Issues

The Issues tracker on GitHub now has over 1,000 issues. The lucky [1000th pull
request][issues-1000th] was opened shortly before August.

The number of open issues/pull requests has been hovering around 180 for awhile
thanks to the great effort of the collaborators. Issues are being closed almost
as fast as they are being opened.

### Documentation Update

As mentioned in last month's newsletter, the documentation has successfully been
moved to [neovim.org/doc/][docs-home].

It features some general documenation links as well as some more specific
reports directed towards developers and contributors.
