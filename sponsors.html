        <p>These are the companies or individuals contributing a monthly amount to
        help sustain Neovim development. See the
        <a href="https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/neovim">bountysource
        campaign</a> for more details.</p>

        <p>I'm a sponsor contributing $5/month but my URL is not listed,
        which is what I expected from the bountysource reward description.
        What is happening?</p>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Bountysource does not yet provide a UI for sponsors to inform their
        URL. Most URLs displayed in the list were obtained using the github API
        and a heuristic to match the bountysource slug(a sort of sponsor
        identifier) with the github username, but this method was error prone
        and failed for many sponsors, including those that don't have a github
        account.</p>

        <p>If you are pledging $5/month or more and want to have your URL
        listed, please send a PR to
        <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/pulls">
        neovim.github.io</a> with a new entry for your bountysource slug in the
        <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/blob/master/js/sponsors-override.js">
        js/sponsors-override.js</a> file. You can obtain your bountysource slug with the
        following command:</p>

        <pre><code>curl --header 'Accept: application/vnd.bountysource+json; version=2' 'https://api.bountysource.com/supporters?team_slug=neovim&amp;per_page=10000&amp;page=1' 2&gt; /dev/null | python -m json.tool | grep -C5 $NAME | grep slug</code></pre>

        <p>where $NAME should be replaced by your bountysource display name(as shown in the sponsor list).</p>

        Where are the original sponsors that used to be shown in the front page?
      </dt>

      <dd>
        <p>To fulfill the $250/month rewards for the new campaign, they were
          moved to a separate <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/original-sponsors">page</a>.</p>
