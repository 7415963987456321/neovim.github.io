<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p> As developers on a more-hackable and flexible Vim, we are drawn to evermore
new ideas. But the relevance and impact of the project hinges on our ability to
balance exploration of the New with execution of the Now. If "mostly-working"
features are not reliable, they may as well not exist—because users will
avoid them. The "multiplier effect" of users and plugin-authors depends on the
reliability of Neovim as a platform.</p>

<p>The roadmap and <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones">milestones</a>
together define the project direction and priorities. Contributions are most
valuable if they focus on these concrete objectives.
Anything that doesn't advance the in-scope goals for the current milestone is postponed.
</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<h3>Meta</h3>
<p>
In addition to version-number milestones, there are meta-milestones used as
"buckets" to separate triaged items from non-triaged items.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Release versions (<code>0.1</code>, <code>0.2</code>, <code>0.3</code>, …) are actual milestones.<ul>
        <li>The nearest upcoming version is assigned a target date.</li>
        <li>Low-risk fixes in the current branch are first committed to the
            stable branch, then merged to master. For example, if the current
            stable release is <code>0.1.1</code> and a bug-fix is assigned to the
            <code>0.2</code> milestone, it does not mean users need to wait until
            <code>0.2</code> to get the fix. The patch will first be committed to the
            stable branch and released with <code>0.1.2</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones/todo">todo</a> is a
      meta-milestone "bucket" for triaged tickets which should be on the
      roadmap but cannot yet be assigned to a concrete milestone.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones/wishlist">wishlist</a>
      is a meta-milestone "bucket" for low-priority items, or items lacking any
      reasonable path to completion under current conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones/0.1-first-public-release">0.1: "whoa"</a></h3>
<p>The primary goal of the <code>0.1</code> release ("first public release") is to reach a
stable, functional baseline that can be built upon and used as a benchmark for
further progress. Releasing a stable product to a larger audience will increase
feedback on potential "blind spots", and will signal the most effective next
direction for the project to focus on.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones/0.2">0.2: "keanu"</a></h3>

High-level goals:
<ul>
    <li>GUI</li>
    <li>Windows support</li>
    <li>Pre-packaged "RelWithDebInfo" build for Windows</li>
    <li>Pre-built binaries for non-Windows platforms (tentative)</li>
</ul>
