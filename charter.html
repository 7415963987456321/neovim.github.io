<h1>Vision</h1>

<p>
Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which
itself derives from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_%28text_editor%29">Stevie</a>).
It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and
derivatives exist, some very clever—but none are Vim. Neovim is built
for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a flexible, extensible Vim with a first-class, fast scripting alternative (lua/luajit)</li>
  <li>Provide a consistent user experience across platforms</li>
  <li>Leverage ongoing Vim development: harmony</li>
  <li>Maintain feature parity with Vim; avoid regressions</li>
  <li>Continue the Vim tradition of backwards compatibility, with few exceptions</li>
  <li>Keep the core small and fast</li>
  <li>Target all platforms supported by libuv</li>
  <li>Optimize <em>out of the box</em>, for new users but especially regular users</li>
  <li>Delegate to plugins, but preserve the utility of the editor core</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Goals</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Turn Vim into an IDE</li>
    <li>Limit third-party applications (such as IDEs!) built with Neovim</li>
    <li> Deprecate VimL</li>
    <li>Vi-compatibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Principles</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Do not regress from origin</li>
    <li> Decide outcomes by weighing cost and benefit</li>
    <li> Use automation to solve problems</li>
    <li> Enable new contributors: remove barriers to entry</li>
    <li> Unblock third parties and plugin authors: allow progress</li>
    <li> In matters of taste or ambiguity, favor tradition/compatibility...</li>
    <li> ...but prefer usability over tradition if the benefits are overwhelming</li>
    <li> Give usability a chance™</li>
</ul>
